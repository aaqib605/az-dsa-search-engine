    "description": " Aryan loves graph theory more than anything. Well, no, he likes to flex his research paper on line graphs to everyone more. To start a conversation with you, he decides to give you a problem on line graphs. In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, the line graph of a simple undirected graph GG is another simple undirected graph L(G)L(G) that represents the adjacency between every two edges in GG.Precisely speaking, for an undirected graph GG without self-loops or multiple edges, its line graph L(G)L(G) is a graph such that  Each vertex of L(G)L(G) represents an edge of GG.  Two vertices of L(G)L(G) are adjacent if and only if their corresponding edges share a common endpoint in GG.   Also, L0(G)=GL^0(G)=G and Lk(G)=L(Lk−1(G))L^k(G)=L(L^{k-1}(G)) for k≥1k\\geq 1. An Euler trail is a sequence of edges that visits every edge of the graph exactly once. This trail can be either a path (starting and ending at different vertices) or a cycle (starting and ending at the same vertex). Vertices may be revisited during the trail, but each edge must be used exactly once.Aryan gives you a simple connected graph GG with nn vertices and mm edges and an integer kk, and it is guaranteed that GG has an Euler trail and it is not a path graph∗^{\\text{∗}}. He asks you to determine if Lk(G)L^k(G) has an Euler trail. ∗^{\\text{∗}}A path graph is a tree where every vertex is connected to atmost two other vertices."

Consider it takes 1 sec for each car to pass the toll, i.e., the first car in a lane has angriness 11, the second car has angriness 22, and so on.To reduce congestion and frustration, cars are allowed to switch lanes. A car can instantly move to the back of any other lane at any time. However, changing lanes increases its angriness by an additional kk units due to the confusion caused by the lane change.Harshith, being the awesome person he is, wants to help the drivers by minimising the total angriness of all cars. He asks Aryan to do so or get fired. Aryan is allowed to change lanes of any car anytime (possibly zero), but his goal is to find the minimum possible total angriness if the lane changes are done optimally.

That is, every element in a segment must also be present in the segment following it.For example, if a=[1,2,2,3,1,5]a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 5], a cool partition Yousef can make is b1=[1,2]b_1 = [1, 2], b2=[2,3,1,5]b_2 = [2, 3, 1, 5]. This is a cool partition because every element in b1b_1 (which are 11 and 22) also appears in b2b_2. In contrast, b1=[1,2,2]b_1 = [1, 2, 2], b2=[3,1,5]b_2 = [3, 1, 5] is not a cool partition, since 22 appears in b1b_1 but not in b2b_2.Note that after partitioning the array, you do not change the order of the segments. Also, note that if an element appears several times in some segment bjb_j, it only needs to appear at least once in bj+1b_{j + 1}.Your task is to help Yousef by finding the maximum number of segments that make a cool partition."

Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums. Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
